# Sorting Algorithms Project 1

This is a Python program that implements various sorting algorithms and visualizes their runtime.

## Sorting Algorithms Included

- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Heap Sort
- Quick Sort (Median-of-Three)
- Selection Sort
- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort

## How to Use

### Required Libraries

- `tkinter`
- `time`
- `random`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`

### Installation

To install the required libraries, you can run the following command:

```
pip install tkinter time random pandas matplotlib
```

### Run the Program

To run the program, you can either run it via the terminal using the command:

```
python sorting.py
```

Or you can directly run the `sorting.py` file using Python.

### How to Use

1. Enter the input size in the input box
2. Select the type of algorithm from the drop-down list
3. Click the "Run" button to run the algorithm and visualize the runtime for the selected algorithm
4. Optionally, click "Run All Algorithms" button to plot the runtimes for all the algorithms included in the program for the selected input size.
